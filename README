NAME

Net::ICQ::On - ICQ Online Tester

SYNOPSIS

  use Net::ICQ::On;

  my $Online=Net::ICQ::On->Test(<ICQ No./>);

  my $Online=Net::ICQ::On->Test(204913808);
  print "My ICQ number is ";
  if ($Online==1) { print "<span style=\"color: green;\">204913808</span>.\n"; }
  else { print "204913808.\n"; }

DESCRIPTION

This module checks the online state of any ICQ user and returns 1 for online or 0 for offline.  It downloads the smallest ICQ online gif and analyses it to determine online state.

It was designed to replace the trademark large ICQ flower GIF from my website with the stated outcome of the online state.

Example uses:  In xhtml, see above example, to display ICQ number in green if online or default colour if offline.  As a gateway for Live Support.  To redirect email link to ICQ message if online.
