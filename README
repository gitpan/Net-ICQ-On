NAME

Net::ICQ::On - ICQ Online Tester

SYNOPSIS

  use Net::ICQ::On;

  my $Online=Net::ICQ::On->Test(<ICQ No./>);

  my $Online=Net::ICQ::On->Test(555123456);
  print "My ICQ number is ";
  if ($Online==1) { print "<span style=\"color: green;\">555123456
</span>.\n"; }
  else { print "555123456.\n"; }

DESCRIPTION

This module tests the online state of any ICQ user and returns 1 for
online or 0 for offline.  It downloads the smallest ICQ online gif and
analyses it to determine the online state of the user.  No ICQ account is
necessary.  No ICQ server login is necessary.  This makes it quick to
return a result.

It was designed to replace the trademark large ICQ flower GIF that ICQ
promotes as a form of online test suitable for webpages because it didn't
fit into the footer of my website.  This was coded initially for my
website and then developed into a useful Perl module registered at CPAN.

Example uses:
* In xhtml, see above example, on a homepage to display your ICQ number
in green if you're online or in the default colour if you're offline.
* As an interface for ICQ cam live support.  Provide the option to
connect via ICQ if you are online else display an email link.
* To redirect email to ICQ if the recipient is online.
